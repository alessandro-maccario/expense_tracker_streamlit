# Expense Tracker

### What is an Expense Tracker? üìä

An Expense Tracker is a tool designed to help users manage and monitor your expenses.
It typically allows users to input their expenses, categorize them, track spending patterns, set budgets, and generate reports to gain insights into their financial habits.

In this project I've used:

- **Python** üêç
- **Streamlit**: A popular open-source framework for building data-driven web applications quickly and easily using Python.
  The reason behind the usage of Streamlit relies on my wish to learn more about this Python package and how far you can achieve using it.

### Why is this useful? ü§î

The entire idea behind using an Expense Tracker is to track in which area you are spending more and to actively decide to reduce the amount spent, in order to be able to save more.
It has been built on the so-called [**FIRE Movement**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement)üî• ideology, which is [_maximize their savings rate by growing the gap between their living expenses and their income, and investing the difference_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement).

### What does this application do? üí°

Simply put, it gives you insight into your financial expenses. An excel spreadsheet would do the work but, let's be honest, the result could be quite ugly and the customization of the plots can be quite daunting. Python & Streamlit seemed the best choice to go with.

### Dashboard explanation

The **delta** value underneath the metrics, shows the current total minus the last 30 days expenses
compare to the 'From' day. If negative, you spent less (green); if positive you spent more (red).

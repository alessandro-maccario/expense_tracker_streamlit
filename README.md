# Expense Tracker

### What is an Expense Tracker? üìä

An Expense Tracker is a tool designed to help users manage and monitor your expenses.
It typically allows users to input their expenses, categorize them, track spending patterns, set budgets, and generate reports to gain insights into their financial habits.

In this project I've used:

- **Python** üêç
- **Streamlit**: A popular open-source framework for building data-driven web applications quickly and easily using Python.
  The reason behind the usage of Streamlit relies on my wish to learn more about this Python package and how far you can achieve using it.

### Why is this useful? ü§î

The entire idea behind using an Expense Tracker is to track in which area you are spending more and to actively decide to reduce the amount spent, in order to be able to save more.
It has been built on the so-called [**FIRE Movement**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement)üî• ideology, which is [_maximize their savings rate by growing the gap between their living expenses and their income, and investing the difference_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement).

### What does this application do? üí°

Simply put, it gives you insight into your financial expenses. Python & Streamlit seemed the best choice to go with due to the easy implementation of a UI.

This tool can immediately answer the following example questions:

- How much, in a certain timeframe, did you spend?
- How much, in a certain timeframe, did you spend and in which category?
- How much, in a certain timeframe, did you spend compared to the last 30 days?
- How much did you spend monthly?
- Comparing two months, in which month did you spend less/more and for what?

### Discover the Dashboard üìö

The dashboard has the following interface:

1. ADD THE FIRST PAGE WHERE YOU LOAD THE DATA. ADD AN ANIMATED GIF TO SHOW WHAT HAS TO BE DONE.

The very first thing to do when you fire up the dashboard is to load the file that contains your data. In the sidebar, you can click on the _Download a sample_ to get an idea of what the file should look like. The only boundary condition, is that the data can be found in the main sheet (for instance, using _Excel_ just one sheet with all the data).

The **delta** value underneath the metrics, shows the current total minus the last 30 days expenses. If negative, you spent less (green), while if positive you spent more (red).

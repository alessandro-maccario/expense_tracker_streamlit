# Expense Tracker

### What is an Expense Tracker?
An Expense Tracker is a tool designed to help users manage and monitor their expenses. 
It typically allows users to input their expenses, categorize them, track spending patterns, set budgets, and generate reports to gain insights into their financial habits.

In this project I've used:
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**: A popular open-source framework for building data-driven web applications quickly and easily using Python.
